# TODO List

## Things to add
Zerg id system

Use Brillo arc to add new movment to zergs
- NEED ZERG ID SYSTEM FOR THIS!
- Probably implement this in moveZergs in Backend.hs

Make the Zergs find the towers instead of finding the center/ going to (0, 0)

Add multiple options for multiple lists to spawn for towers

Use Brillo bitmap to load custom images

## Bugs to Fix
Stop kill count from incrementing when Zergs hit the tower. 

## Things to Remove or Clean Up
Anything to do with Juicy Pixels, we will not be using that
